    "# GenAI-Powered Healthcare Assistant: Smarter Symptom Insights with Gemini\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In a world where health concerns can arise at any moment, people often turn to the internet to make sense of their symptoms. Unfortunately, the answers they find are usually generic, overwhelming, or even misleading. What if there was a way to get personalized, conversational, and medically informed responses using the power of Generative AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project leverages **Google's Gemini models** to create an intelligent healthcare assistant that can engage in natural dialogue, interpret symptoms, suggest possible diagnoses, and recommend next steps—all within seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Audience: The primary audience for this **AI-Powered Healthcare Assistant** includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Patients: Individuals seeking immediate, reliable information about their symptoms and potential health conditions.\n",
    "- Healthcare Providers: Medical professionals looking for tools to enhance patient engagement and streamline the diagnostic process.\n",
    "- Caregivers: Family members or friends assisting patients in managing health concerns and seeking appropriate care.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Traditional symptom checkers and online search results often lack personalization and contextual accuracy. Users are either bombarded with too much irrelevant information or given vague responses that leave them confused. There's a growing need for a smarter, more interactive system that provides **reliable and human-like health guidance** based on user inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Solution\n",
    "We present a **GenAI-powered healthcare chatbot** that:\n",
    "- Understands and processes natural language symptom descriptions,\n",
    "- Identifies likely medical conditions,\n",
    "- Provides treatment suggestions and preventive tips,\n",
    "- Retrieves relevant medical knowledge from a custom-trained database (RAG),\n",
    "- Responds in both human-friendly paragraphs and structured JSON formats for API-readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Techniques Used\n",
    "- **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash API** for conversational AI and content generation.\n",
    "- **Prompt Engineering**: Few-shot prompting for high-quality, domain-specific responses.\n",
    "- **Config Tuning**: Fine control using temperature, top-p, and token limits.\n",
    "- **Structured Output**: Enforcing JSON response schema using TypedDict.\n",
    "- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Using ChromaDB and Gemini embeddings to pull in relevant medical knowledge based on symptoms.\n",
    "- **SQL Integration**: Simulating a backend with SQLite for structured symptom-to-diagnosis mappings.\n",
    "- **Interactive Chat**: Maintaining session-based chats for natural interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook blends **conversational AI**, **information retrieval**, and **structured data workflows** to deliver a robust prototype for intelligent virtual healthcare support.\n"

    "# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Its Role in AI-Powered Healthcare Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is a method based on the integration of **information retrieval** and **generative models** to enhance responsiveness and relevance of the response. The operation is carried out by initially retrieving associated data or documents from a query and then producing an answer by integrating the retrieved content along with the response abilities of the model. This method enhances the answers to a richer quality with more context so that the resulting answers are well-informed and correct where alone, the model's training would not be able to capture every subtlety.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use RAG for healthcare assistant?\n",
    "RAG is useful to an AI-based health assistant by facilitating dynamic information retrieval from the outside world, e.g., medical stores or files. Upon receiving user input in terms of symptoms or medication requests, the assistant queries against the knowledge store, retrieves pertinent data, and builds contextual correct answers. Through this activity, the assistant provides up-to-date as well as accurate information, enhancing user satisfaction and facilitating sound decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "I utilized **ChromaDB** as the vector database to store and retrieve pertinent medical documents. Upon a user submitting a query (e.g., \"What do I do if I am nauseous after eating peanuts?\"), the system first queries the database for pertinent documents using the **embedding function**.\n",
    "Once the system identifies the most appropriate document(s), it merges the information with the generative model to create a response exclusively for the user's question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Source\n",
    "The data for this project was sourced into **11 small medical documents** available on the official NHS website [Illnesses and conditions](https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/)  \n",
    "These documents contain information about various medical conditions, symptoms, and treatments. "

    "data=\"\"\"A cold is a common mild viral infection that typically affects the nose and throat and usually resolves within 1 to 2 weeks. Symptoms include a sore throat, blocked or runny nose, sneezing, cough, hoarse voice, and general fatigue, while less frequent symptoms may involve fever, headache, earache, muscle aches, mild eye irritation, and loss of taste and smell. Remedies to alleviate symptoms include getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, eating a balanced diet, taking over-the-counter pain relief for fever and aches, using decongestants for nasal congestion, and trying home remedies like gargling salt water or sucking menthol sweets. Preventive measures include regular handwashing, coughing or sneezing into tissues, and avoiding sharing utensils, towels, or toys to reduce the spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flu, or influenza, is a common viral illness that spreads easily, particularly during the winter months. It often comes on quickly with symptoms such as a sudden high fever, tiredness, headaches, general aches, a dry cough, sore throat, and chills. Additional symptoms can include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and nasal congestion. Most people recover within a week, though fatigue and a lingering cough may persist longer. To alleviate symptoms, rest, stay hydrated, keep warm, and take over-the-counter medications like paracetamol or ibuprofen for fever and aches. Preventive measures include regular handwashing, covering your mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, cleaning commonly touched surfaces, avoiding close contact with others while infectious, and getting the annual flu vaccine to stay protected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allergies occur when the body's immune system reacts to certain substances, known as allergens, as if they are harmful. Allergies are common, affecting over 1 in 4 people in the UK, and they can develop at any age. Common allergens include pollen, dust mites, animal dander, certain foods like nuts and shellfish, insect stings, medications, latex, mould, and household chemicals. Symptoms of an allergic reaction usually appear quickly and can include sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, red and itchy eyes, wheezing, coughing, skin rashes, and worsened asthma or eczema. Severe reactions, such as anaphylaxis, require urgent medical treatment. Allergies can often be managed by avoiding allergens and using treatments like antihistamines, decongestants, creams, and steroids. For severe cases, immunotherapy may be recommended to gradually reduce sensitivity to allergens. Preventing allergic reactions involves maintaining good hygiene, reading food labels, and minimizing exposure to known allergens.\n",
    "\n",
    "High blood pressure (hypertension) is a condition where the force of blood against the walls of the arteries is consistently too high, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases like heart attack or stroke. It is typically diagnosed when blood pressure readings are regularly above 140/90 mmHg. Common risk factors include a high-fat or high-salt diet, lack of exercise, obesity, smoking, excessive alcohol intake, stress, certain medications, and underlying conditions like kidney disease or diabetes. Hypertension often has no symptoms, but in rare cases, it may cause headaches, blurred vision, nosebleeds, or shortness of breath. Managing high blood pressure involves regular exercise, a healthy low-salt diet, reduced alcohol and caffeine intake, weight loss if necessary, and relaxation techniques such as yoga. Medications such as ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, or beta-blockers may be prescribed and might need to be taken long-term. Monitoring blood pressure regularly is essential to ensure effective treatment and lifestyle adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arthritis is a common condition that causes pain and inflammation in the joints, affecting people of all ages, including children. The two most common types are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, but other types include gout, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis. Symptoms vary depending on the type but generally include joint pain, tenderness, stiffness, inflammation, restricted movement, weakness, and warm, red skin around the joints. While there is no cure, treatments like painkillers, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), physiotherapy, and regular exercise can help manage the condition. In severe cases, surgery such as joint replacement or fusion may be necessary. Protecting joints through proper posture, using supportive tools, and making ergonomic adjustments at home can reduce strain and prevent further damage. Occupational therapy can assist with maintaining independence in daily tasks, and a tailored approach combining treatments is often the most effective way to manage arthritis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Migraine is a common health condition that often begins in early adulthood, affecting around 1 in 5 women and 1 in 15 men. It is characterized by a throbbing headache, typically on one side of the head, which may occur frequently or sporadically over years. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, sweating, dizziness, and abdominal pain, often lasting between 4 hours to 3 days, with some people also experiencing aura, such as visual disturbances or tingling sensations, before the headache. Triggers can include hormonal changes, stress, fatigue, dietary factors like caffeine or chocolate, dehydration, and environmental stimuli like bright lights or loud sounds. Though the exact cause is unknown, it is linked to abnormal brain activity and may have a genetic component. Managing migraines involves identifying triggers, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and using treatments like painkillers or prescribed medications. Proper diagnosis by a GP is essential to rule out other conditions and determine the appropriate course of action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common, long-term condition of the digestive system that can persist throughout life, though symptoms may change over time. It does not pose a serious risk to physical health and is not linked to cancer or other bowel-related diseases. The exact cause is unknown, but symptoms such as abdominal pain or cramping, changes in bowel habits (diarrhoea or constipation), bloating, and excessive wind can vary in severity and often worsen with stress or certain foods. Less common symptoms include lethargy, nausea, and heartburn. IBS can impact daily life and may lead to stress or low mood. Diagnosis typically involves symptom history and tests to rule out other conditions like coeliac disease. Management strategies include working with a GP to identify triggers and avoid dietary changes until necessary testing is completed. While IBS can be managed with the right approach, further symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, bleeding, or lumps should prompt urgent medical evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common infections affecting the bladder, kidneys, and related tubes, with women more likely to experience them. UTIs can cause symptoms like frequent or painful urination, cloudy or foul-smelling urine, and lower abdominal pain, while upper UTIs may include fever, back pain, and nausea. Most UTIs are treated with antibiotics and improve within 3 to 5 days, though chronic UTIs may require longer treatments. Preventive measures include staying hydrated, wiping from front to back, emptying the bladder fully, and avoiding irritants like perfumed soaps. If symptoms worsen or don’t improve, consulting a GP is crucial, as untreated UTIs can lead to serious complications like kidney infections or sepsis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obesity is a condition characterized by excessive body fat that can lead to serious health issues, affecting around one in four adults and one in five children in the UK. It is typically measured using Body Mass Index (BMI), with a BMI of 30 or above classified as obese. A waist circumference over 94 cm in men and 80 cm in women can further indicate obesity-related health risks, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, certain cancers, and stroke. Obesity is primarily caused by consuming more calories than are burned through physical activity, often due to modern lifestyles involving high-calorie diets and sedentary habits. Treatment involves adopting a calorie-controlled diet, engaging in regular exercise, and seeking psychological support to change eating behaviors. In some cases, medication like orlistat or, rarely, weight loss surgery may be recommended. Preventing and addressing obesity is essential to improving overall health and quality of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), also known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), is a long-term neurological condition affecting the nervous and immune systems, causing severe fatigue and pain that doesn’t improve with sleep or rest. A hallmark symptom is post-exertional malaise (PEM), where even minimal activity leads to debilitating exhaustion, which might appear days later. Other symptoms include broken sleep, brain fog, dizziness, nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and muscle pain. The condition affects individuals of all ages, genders, and backgrounds and can vary in severity, with periods of improvement and worsening. While the exact cause is unknown, potential triggers include infections, trauma, or major life stressors. Diagnosis requires ruling out other conditions, often through symptom tracking and routine tests. Though there is no cure, management strategies such as pacing, dietary advice, medication, counselling, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. It is crucial to work with a GP to create a tailored approach for symptom management.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fever is typically identified when body temperature rises to 38°C or higher, often accompanied by sensations of warmth, chills, or shivering. It is the body’s natural response to infections such as flu, tonsillitis, or urinary tract infections (UTIs), helping to stimulate the immune system and hinder the survival of bacteria and viruses. Most fevers resolve within a few days and can be managed by resting, staying hydrated, wearing comfortable clothing, and taking fever-reducing medications like paracetamol. It’s important to avoid over-layering or attempting to cool down forcefully, as this may worsen symptoms. Seek medical advice if the fever persists, worsens, or is accompanied by severe symptoms such as confusion, muscle cramps, or unusual thirst. Fever, although uncomfortable, plays an essential role in fighting infections.\"\"\"\n",

       "A fever is typically identified when body temperature rises to 38°C or higher, often accompanied by sensations of warmth, chills, or shivering. It is the body’s natural response to infections such as flu, tonsillitis, or urinary tract infections (UTIs), helping to stimulate the immune system and hinder the survival of bacteria and viruses. Most fevers resolve within a few days and can be managed by resting, staying hydrated, wearing comfortable clothing, and taking fever-reducing medications like paracetamol. It’s important to avoid over-layering or attempting to cool down forcefully, as this may worsen symptoms. Seek medical advice if the fever persists, worsens, or is accompanied by severe symptoms such as confusion, muscle cramps, or unusual thirst. Fever, although uncomfortable, plays an essential role in fighting infections."

       "Allergies occur when the body's immune system reacts to certain substances, known as allergens, as if they are harmful. Allergies are common, affecting over 1 in 4 people in the UK, and they can develop at any age. Common allergens include pollen, dust mites, animal dander, certain foods like nuts and shellfish, insect stings, medications, latex, mould, and household chemicals. Symptoms of an allergic reaction usually appear quickly and can include sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, red and itchy eyes, wheezing, coughing, skin rashes, and worsened asthma or eczema. Severe reactions, such as anaphylaxis, require urgent medical treatment. Allergies can often be managed by avoiding allergens and using treatments like antihistamines, decongestants, creams, and steroids. For severe cases, immunotherapy may be recommended to gradually reduce sensitivity to allergens. Preventing allergic reactions involves maintaining good hygiene, reading food labels, and minimizing exposure to known allergens."

    "\n",
    "The technique starts by preprocesses the query of the user into a clear, single-line input. Then, a framed prompt is constructed, directing the AI model to give a crisp, informative, and well-padded response. The prompt further contains directives on highlighting the illness, offering solutions, and suppressing irrelevant content. Pertinent passages of medical material retrieved from the vector database are added to the prompt to bolster contextual understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the prompt is submitted to the Gemini model (`gemini-2.0-flash`) which returns a context-specific response as per both the query of the user and reference documents. Then, the output is presented in clean Markdown-readable form so the answer is easily comprehensible."

    "## Summary of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This project presents an AI-powered healthcare assistant that leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide reliable, context-aware responses to user queries related to health conditions, symptoms, and treatments. By integrating **LangChain**, **ChromaDB**, and **OpenAI’s language models**, the system retrieves relevant information from publicly available healthcare documents sourced from **NHS Inform** and generates informative responses. This approach ensures that the answers are grounded in trusted data, making the assistant both explainable and useful for general healthcare awareness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case Value \n",
    "\n",
    "The assistant serves as a bridge between medical knowledge and public understanding, making healthcare information more accessible to everyday users. It can be particularly valuable for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Individuals seeking initial understanding of medical symptoms or conditions.\n",
    "* Students and learners looking for simplified, accurate health information.\n",
    "* Healthcare support systems where factual and fast retrieval of medical insights is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps?\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance the functionality, usability, and scalability of the assistant, the following improvements are planned:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **User Interface Integration**: Build a frontend using Streamlit or Gradio for interactive access.\n",
    "* **Multi-turn Conversations**: Add memory modules to enable contextual dialogues across multiple queries.\n",
    "* **Authentication**: Add basic authentication for tracking user sessions or personalizing responses.\n",
    "* **Deployment**: Host the assistant on platforms like Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Cloud.\n",
    "* **Model Flexibility**: Allow switching between different LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face).\n",
    "* **Future Expansion**: Explore adding multimodal capabilities (e.g., medical image support) for richer functionality."
